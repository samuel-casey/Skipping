Total folate intake was not associated with overall risk of breast cancer. However, among women who consumed at least 15 g/d of alcohol, the risk of breast cancer was highest among those with low folate intake. For total folate intake of at least 600 µg/d compared with 150 to 299 µg/d, the multivariate relative risk (RR) was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.76; P for trend=.001). This association was only slightly attenuated after additional adjustment for intake of beta carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, preformed vitamin A, and total vitamins C and E. The risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol intake was strongest among women with total folate intake of less than 300 µg/d (for alcohol intake ≥15 g/d vs <15 g/d, multivariate RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50). For women who consumed at least 300 µg/d of total folate, the multivariate RR for intake of at least 15 g/d of alcohol vs less than 15 g/d was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.92-1.20). Current use of multivitamin supplements, the major source of folate, was associated with lower breast cancer risk among women who consumed at least 15 g/d of alcohol (for current users of supplements vs never users, RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the excess risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol consumption may be reduced by adequate folate intake.

Michels 61 (Harvard University), Barry M. Popkin 317 (Harvard University)+ 5 AuthorsFrank E. Speizer 170 (Brigham and Women's Hospital) Abstract Summary Background The relation between breastfeeding and breast-cancer risk has been examined in many studies; some have reported no association, and others a reduced risk, particularly among premenopausal women. In the only prospective cohort study, no association was found. We have assessed prospectively the association between breastfeeding and incidence of breast cancer among 89887 women in the US Nurses' Health Study.

Oakley 2 Since the mid-1970s, 25 percent of American adults have regularly consumed a multivitamin containing 400 μg of folic acid. The current evidence suggests that people who take such supplements and their children are healthier. This evidence raises the question of whether physicians and other health care professionals should recommend that all adults take a multivitamin daily. “Folate” is the generic term for compounds that have vitamin activity similar to that of pterolymonoglutamic acid (also cal...more 74 Citations Source Cite Add To Collection Alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk among women under age 45 years Published on May 1, 1997in Epidemiology 4.99 Christine A.

The Public Health Service has issued the recommendation that all women of childbearing age in the United States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400 micrograms of folic acid/day for the purpose of reducing this risk.

This form was administered twice to 173 participants at an interval of approximately one year (1980-1981), and four one-week diet records for each subject were collected during that period.

Kannel 177 (Boston University) The purpose of this paper is to indicate how repeated measures on risk factors have been employed in the prediction of the development of disease in the Framingham Heart Study. Since these measures vary over time, the method accounts for time dependent covariates. The technique is a generalized person-years approach in that it treats each observation interval (of equal length) as a mini-follow-up study in which the current risk factor measurements are employed to predict an event in the interval...more 219 Citations Source Cite Add To Collection THE USE OF A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS DIET FOUR YEARS IN THE PAST Published on Jan 1, 1988in American Journal of Epidemiology 4.32 Barry M.
